- config file of some kind
    - lint preferences
    - build output type
    - library name and/or version?
- main.bgl has special status as an entry-point
    - autoruns can only be initialized here (can they be imported wholesale from 
      elsewhere?)
        - autoruns are internal to stores, but have to be activated?
            from './my-store.bgl' import MyStore
            active MyStore
        - stores can't be used at all if they haven't been activated?
        - or, have to activate stores' autoruns individually?
    - global event listeners can only be set up here, including main(), which
      will really be an event listener for program startup
    - resembles the entrypoint to an express or flask app; routes, for example,
      may be imported from elsewhere and then hooked up centrally
    - special syntax for event listeners?
- individual bagel files outside of a workspace
    - can export declarations with no side-effects
    - can be imported over the internet
    - can be built individually, without a main or a project config, with a 
      1-to-1 correspondence to output JS files
- libraries are shipped as a folder of non-main files
