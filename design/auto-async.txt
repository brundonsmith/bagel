- Function types have a hidden "async" property
- Any function that calls an async function is automatically "colored" as async
- Base fetch function designed to heavily favor non-mutating requests
- All async dependencies in a function call (recursive?) are gathered and run 
in parallel
- Behaves as if everything were async and awaited, but doesn't actually do that 
for performance reasons
