MVP:
- more helpful error messages
    - Type errors
    - "error productions" for common errors; ESPECIALLY things that are different from JS
- error handling system for procs
- hoisting (types and declarations)
- reactivity
- parsing
    - "JSX"
    - classes
    - comments
    - string escapes
    - template strings
    - spread/destructuring
    - types
        - nominal types
        - iterator types
        - promise types
    - dynamic property definition/access (square brackets)
    - anonymous blocks
- "typeof X" in type expressions
- "typeof X" at runtime (add "array" return value, to avoid Array.isArray(), as well as class-name possibility)
- array indexing (and slicing? (into iterators??))
- JS interop
- config file (bagel.config.json)
    - allowIOInFunctions
    - allowJSInFunctions

Ideas:
- named arguments?
- optional object properties (types)?
- "with" declarations inside functions?
- other numeric types like hex?

Long-term:
- full build system
- language server
- package manager
