core language:
- parsing
    - "JSX"
    - classes
    - comments
    - template strings
    - statements
        - assignment
        - var decl
        - if/else
        - for and while loops (only for/of, because we have ranges!)
    - spread/destructuring
    - types
        - nominal types
        - iterator types
        - promise types
    - dynamic property definition/access (square brackets)
- more helpful error messages
- error handling in procs
- hoisting (types and declarations)
- named arguments?
- optional object properties (types)?
- "with" declarations inside functions?
- "typeof X" in type expressions
- "typeof X" at runtime (add "array" return value, to avoid Array.isArray(), as well as class-name possibility)

long-term:
- syntax highlighting
- full build system
- language server
- package manager
