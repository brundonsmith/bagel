Notes from Elm:
- Events like onClick in Elm just take a value (msg); we take a proc
- Elm has no optional arguments?
- classList function is built-in
- Deeper type inference- Elm allows the total absence of type declarations
even on top-level declarations
- Automatic decoding should allow us to skip hand-written decoders
