Modules are loaded by URL; Bagel knows nothing of repositories, versioning, or even packages

*However*, std lib needs to be hosted and will also serve as a reference-implementation for "properly" serving up Bagel modules

Current plan:
- Put it in its own repository, like a third-party library would be
- Tag commits with semver
- Pipeline to push new versions to CDN, organized by *exact* version number
- Cloudflare worker (source kept in the same repository) will accept semver *patterns*, and serve up the appropriate version based on what's on the CDN
