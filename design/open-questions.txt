
MVP:
- async/await (function keyword? what about async procs?)
- passing foreign objects to pure functions (dirty function calls?)

Later:
- handling concurrent functions when classes are allowed to be passed to 
functions (limit to serializable only? automatically reapply prototype on the 
other side?)
