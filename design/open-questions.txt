
MVP:
- modules, especially external modules
- standard APIs, especially global APIs
- async/await (function keyword? what about async procs?)
- consts are deeply immutable? may be intractable...
    - but the "const applies to the reference only" is confusing
    - but we need at least JS-level consts
    - consts can only be literals? that might make it tractable, because no 
    external references (TS-style consts)
    - can pure functions create circular object graphs?
- passing foreign objects to pure functions (dirty function calls?)

Later:
- handling concurrent functions when classes are allowed to be passed to 
functions (limit to serializable only? automatically reapply prototype on the 
other side?)
