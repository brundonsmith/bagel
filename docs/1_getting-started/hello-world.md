title: Hello World!
---

Now that you've got Bagel installed, let's take it for a spin.

Create a new Bagel file named `hello-world.bgl`:

```
proc main() {
    log('Hello world!');
}
```

Now, in a terminal, run the file:
```
bagel run hello-world.bgl
```

> Note: Make sure your terminal is in the directory where `hello-world.bgl` can be found!

It should print out the message!
```
Hello, world!
```
